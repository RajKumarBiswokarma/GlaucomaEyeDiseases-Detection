# GlaucomaEyeDiseases-Detection

# Description

The Glaucoma Eye Diseases Prediction project utilizes the InspectionV2 architecture to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the presence of glaucoma in eye images. Glaucoma is a serious eye condition that can lead to vision loss and blindness if not detected and treated early. This project aims to leverage the power of deep learning algorithms to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of glaucoma, enabling timely intervention and better patient outcomes.




# Dataset

Dataset that relies in this project is from kaggle where there are three different datasets and   used  all together. This datasets are opensource. The Paper of the dataset are:
