# GlaucomaEyeDiseases-Detection

# Description

The Glaucoma Eye Diseases Prediction project utilizes the InspectionV2 architecture to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the presence of glaucoma in eye images. Glaucoma is a serious eye condition that can lead to vision loss and blindness if not detected and treated early. This project aims to leverage the power of deep learning algorithms to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of glaucoma, enabling timely intervention and better patient outcomes.Glaucoma is referred as an eye disease that damage optic nerve and cause vision loss. Doctors need to perform many tests such as: Ophthalmic Test, Tonometry, Ophthalmoscopy, Perimetry, Pachymetry, Gonioscopy. After gettingresults from different test, doctor have to decide whether it is a Glaucomatous eye or not. Some of the methods used to detect Glaucoma include the Topcon image net method, optical coherence tomography, and the retinal nerve fibre layer analyser. However due to high cost and lack of research in this field . 




# Dataset

Dataset that relies in this project is from kaggle where there are three different datasets and i have used a all together. The Paper of the dataset are:

ORIGA: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21095735/

REFUGE: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/refuge-retinal-fundus-glaucoma-challenge

G1020: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09158

Total of 745 images where 486 images are Glaucoma negative image and 259 Glaucoma positive images.
